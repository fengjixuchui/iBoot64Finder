IV. Notes
	> SecureROM is not a priority but I will add a support for later,
	> I highly advise to use this tool on the lastest versions (iOS 7.1.x | 12.4.x | ...),
	> An issue is known for iBoot & LLB of the DTK, if you want the support just open an issue,
	> This project was made for programming skills and knowledges improvement with bootloaders.

IV. Notes
	> Please let me know if you notice any bugs or bad found addresses !!

	> This project was made for programming skills and knowledges improvement with bootloaders.
	> This new version is now using an other technique than the previous one : retreiving functions using xrefs,
	> i64f is now only supporting iOS 10 to 14 because the other versions are becoming very old... however, you can still use the old iBoot64Finder binary in the release for the versions below if you need to.
